# HireHustle

This is the Central Hub for HireHustle Graduation Project.

## Overview

- Cairo University Graduation Project which received an outstanding A+ grade and positive feedback from project mentors and academic faculty for the innovative approach and practical implementation of the system.
- HireHustle is an applicant tracking system that helps HR in recruitment processes by using Artificial Intelligence (Semantic Similarity) that should take CVs and should rank them based on the intended job post.
- We developed 2 mobile applications, 1 for HR and the other for the applicant, a backend for both applications and we developed a web application for admin panel.
